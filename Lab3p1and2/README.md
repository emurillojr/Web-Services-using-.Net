Lab 3<br>
<b>Problem 1</b><br>
You will again use the wUnderground web service but this time return from forecast<br>
The day (title)<br>
The forecast description (fcttext)<br>
 
<b>Problem 2</b><br>
For this task, you will use the website www.geonames.org.<br>
For this program, you will need to make web service calls to accomplish the following tasks:<br>
List all cities for a given zip code<br>
List all nearby cities for a given zip code<br>
These are two different buttons in your application, do not combine the two operations.<br>
Note, you will not be able to discover this webservice, you must make a direct call to it via HTTP;<br>
In both cases you will output the zip code and city.<br>
The user will enter a zip code. (it only takes 5 digit zip codes):<br>
for example (02864 vs 0286)
